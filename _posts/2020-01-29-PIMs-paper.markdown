Delighted to announce the publication of my new paper on the use of Polymers with Intrinsic Microporosity (PIMs) to enhance the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction activity of copper catalysts. This was an excellent collaboration between researchers at University of Southampton, McGill University, Edinburgh University and Schaeffler. 

We use a stepwise approach to add varying thicknesses of polymer layer to copper catalysts on gas diffusion electrodes. We show that the PIMs are able to enhance the activity and selectivity of the catalysts, but also have a negative impact on the hydrophobicity of the gas diffusion electrode. By selecting a compromise PIMs loading, we are able to increase the overall activity and selectivity of the copper gas diffusion electrodes for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction specifically to ethylene.

### Abstract

CO<sub>2</sub> reduction offers an attractive alternative green synthetic route for ethylene, especially where CO<sub>2</sub> could be sourced from industrial exhausts and in combination with green power sources. However, practical applications are currently limited due to the unfortunately low selectivity of cathode materials towards ethylene. This work uses polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) to improve the performance of copper gas diffusion electrodes for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to ethylene. We report an improved selectivity and activity towards ethylene with the addition of a thin PIMs layer, which is seen as improved Faradaic efficiency, increased stability and a shift in the reduction to lower overpotential. This improvement is highly dependent on the thickness of the added polymer layer, with too thick a layer having a detrimental impact on the hydrophobicity of the gas diffusion layer. With a compromise in loading, PIMs can be used to enhance the activity and selectivity of catalysts for targeted CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to ethylene.
