Happy to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in The Journal of the Electrochemical Society for the focus issue on Mathematical Modeling of Electrochemical Systems at Multiple Scales in honour of John Newman. Here, we describe a new finite element simulation model for predicting the shape of polarization curves for a number of corroding metals.

Most digital analyses of corroding systems assume that reactions at the metal surface are defined either by the potential energy suppled (activation control) or the rate of mass transport to the electrode (mass transport control). Real samples show a mixture of both of these limitations, and so our model works to take both features into account. This new model shows excellent agreement with experimental data, both for corrosive resistant and corrosion susceptible materials.
