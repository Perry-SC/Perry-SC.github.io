Happy to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in The Journal of the Electrochemical Society for the focus issue on Mathematical Modeling of Electrochemical Systems at Multiple Scales in honour of John Newman. Here, we describe a new finite element simulation model for predicting the shape of polarization curves for a number of corroding metals.

Most digital analyses of corroding systems assume that reactions at the metal surface are defined either by the potential energy suppled (activation control) or the rate of mass transport to the electrode (mass transport control). Real samples show a mixture of both of these limitations, and so our model works to take both features into account. This new model shows excellent agreement with experimental data, both for corrosive resistant and corrosion susceptible materials.

### Abstract

Potentiodynamic polarization curves are often performed to characterize the bulk corrosion properties of a material in terms of its corrosion potential, rate, and Tafel kinetics in a given environment. This requires approaching them as one of two extreme cases, with purely activation or diffusion controlling the measured currents. For the intermediate behavior displayed by many real samples, making this assumption is a significant source of error. In this work, a finite element model has been developed which considers both of these contributions simultaneously for experimental data with a broad material scope. This has been used to examine both extremely corrosion vulnerable samples in two magnesium alloys and extremely corrosion resistant samples in two steels. The effectiveness of several goodness of fit statistics in comparing the similarity between experimental and simulated data has also been assessed.
