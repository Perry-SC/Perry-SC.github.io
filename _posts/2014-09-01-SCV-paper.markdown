Happy to announce the publication of our new paper from the Denuault group in Analytical Chemistry. Here, we describe a new voltammetry technique - Sampled Current Voltammetry at Microelectrodes (MSCV)

Here, data are collected by performing a series of separate potential step experiments along a potential range of interests. By sampling the recorded current transients at the same time, a MSCV can be constructed. Alongside this technique, we give a new kinetic model that allows the user to simply extract kinetic information from MSCVs based on the slope of the MSCV wave.
