It's not often you attend a scientific communication event that is so significantly different to any other event you've previously attended. Today I was fortunate to attend the STEM for Britain event held at The Houses of Parliament. At first glace it may have seemed like a traditional poster conference. However, this event was different as it wasn't only attended by academics, but also policy makers and Members of Parliament.

The concept of the event is to invite Early Career Researchers to present ground-breaking UK research in **S**cience **T**echnology, **E**ngineering and **M**athematics to Members of both Houses of Parliament. The event boasted a strong history of linking Research and Policy. In it's current form (previously called SET for Britain), the event has been running since 2006, although previous events extend back to the 19th Century. One speaker told a story of Michael Faraday presenting his work on electricity to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, William Gladstone. When Gladstone asked about the usefulness of electricity, Faraday replied *"Why, Sir, there is every probability that you will soon be able to tax it"*. 

I have to admit, before my attendance I was a little sceptical about how research would be received by MPs, and how well the event would be attended. I am delighted to report that the event was a bustling hub of conversation, with many participants, inlcuding myself, receiving visitings from local MPs, misters aides and policy makers. The non-partisan nature of the event was quickly established through visits from both the Science Minister and Shadow Fiance Minister in quick succession. 

One thing that did become apparent was how important it is to master Scientific Communication as a skill for a wide variety of audiences. Posters that had been repurposed from subjust specific conferences lead to difficult conversations, with more time devoted to decyphering jargon that discussing research innovations. Posters that were designed for the target non-specialist audiences facilitated a much greater depth of dicussion. I was pleasently surprised how insightful questions can be from a lay audience, although, as with every event I speak at, I went home with a stack of notes for how to edit my next draft! It just goes to show the Scientific Communication is a learned skill; we can always get better, and the best way to improve is to get out there and practice! 

My poster detailed the latest work from my group, developing a reactor capable of converting CO<sub>2</sub> into ethylene oxide. The feel of the poster was entirely different compared to a specialist subject conference. Reaction mechanisms and detailed figures were replaced with schematics and flow diagrams to help walk the reader through the broader concepts. There's plenty of time to ask detailed questions at the sessions, so why bog down the poster? In my mind this highlights the key challenge in poster presentations for a non-specialist audience: the poster must be detailed enough to give understanding whilst not overwhelming the reader with technicalities. The final result can be seen below (click the image to see the full sized version if you're interested).

My main take-away from this event is that more people are interested in the latest research than you might think, particularly those involved in policy, industry and other similar sectors. But, the level of interest you received is less dependent on the novelty of your work, and more dependent on how accessible you make it. As a good starting point, it's helpful to remember the following:

*Keep text to a miniumum*

This is good advice for all posters but particularly relevant here!

*Avoid jargon at all costs, and keep acronyms to a minimum*

Nothing kills the flow of a poster like having to constantly look back and forward to remember the difference between SEM and SECM

*Custom design your figure to highlight the main results clearly and simply*

Often this will involve removing datasets or (what you might think of as) over-simplifying. A good rule of thumb is to treat figures as graphical abstracts, simple, clear and to the point. 

*Number your sections*

Also a good idea for all poster conferences, but particularly useful to make sure the reader doesn't miss important information from Section 4 that they need to understand section 5. 

*Highlight key points*

Use **bold**, *italics* or <u>underline</u> to highlight the most important points. What stands out more, a catalyst thirty times more effective than competitors, or a catalyst **thirty times more effective** than competitors?

*Make yourself accessible*

By definition a simplified poster has to omit some level of information. You reader will likely want to ask lots of questions, but also may think of further questions later on their way home. Add mulitple contact options to allow your reader to contact you. The connection may be made on the day, or maybe it will come by email on the train home!
