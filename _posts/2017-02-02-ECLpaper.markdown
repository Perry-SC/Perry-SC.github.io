Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in ChemElectroChem. Here, we show a new electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) design where the entire cell is contained within a standard quartz cuvette.

Through careful experimental design with simulated verification, we show how a custom cell can be built around a simple glass cuvette. The cuvette is already optimised for spectroscopic data collection, and so our modifications for electrochemical data provide a simple means to provide high precision ECL information.
