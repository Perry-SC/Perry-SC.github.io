Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in ChemElectroChem. Here, we show a new electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) design where the entire cell is contained within a standard quartz cuvette.

Through careful experimental design with simulated verification, we show how a custom cell can be built around a simple glass cuvette. The cuvette is already optimised for spectroscopic data collection, and so our modifications for electrochemical data provide a simple means to provide high precision ECL information.

### Abstract

Herein, we validate a novel cuvette-based approach to measure electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) by employing the hyphenation of a commercial spectrometer and a potentiostat. The new experimental design provides simultaneous acquisition of electrochemical and ECL data, allowing complementary analysis by both techniques. Preliminary analysis of an organometallic ECL standard, tris(2,2â€²-bipyridine)ruthenium(II) (Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup>), and tripropylamine (TPA), showed excellent reproducibility both in terms of the electrochemistry and the ECL signal. Equally as important, the acquired electrochemistry and ECL from the Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub><sup>2+</sup>/TPA system served as a baseline for evaluating the ECL response of polymerizable ruthenium luminophores.
