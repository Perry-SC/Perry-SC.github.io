Excited to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in The Journal of the Electrochemical Society focus issue on the Brain and Electrochemistry, honouring R. Mark Whiteman and Christian Amatore. Here, we show a quick and highly effective means of enhancing the sensitivity of enzymatic biosensors through electrode surface modifications.

These enzymatic sensors work by producing equal amount of hydrogen peroxide per target molecule observed. The hydrogen peroxide is then oxidised at the electrode as the means of detection. Hydrogen peroxide oxidation is highly surface dependent, as the peroxide must adsorb onto the electrode for the electron transfer to occur.

We demonstrate that roughening a platinum microelectrode before using it to fabricate an enzymatic biosensor givevs a massive increase in the sensitivity and a corresponding decrease in the limit of detection, without noticably impacting the response time.

### Abstract

The field of enzymatic biosensors applied to brain electrochemistry has rapidly expanded over the last few years, thanks in part to their excellent selectivity to specific target species. Much current research is therefore focused on enhancing the electrochemical signal, which often involves the detection of stoichiometric amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formed as part of the enzyme mechanism. This opens the possibility of enhancing a biosensor's performance by facilitating the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation signal through surface modification. Here, we investigate the impact of the roughness of the platinum surface on the biosensor response, where rougher platinum surfaces show greater activity for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> oxidation, and therefore enhanced biosensor sensitivity. Through careful manipulation of the electrode surface roughness, we are able to show a significant improvement to the LOD when using a rougher electrode surface. Additionally, we have shown that this enhanced surface roughness has no detrimental effects toward the electrode response time. This suggests that surface roughness could be a simple and easy to implement means of enhancing the sensitivity of electrode-based enzymatic biosensors, and is an important factor to consider when studying other aspects of biosensor fabrication.
