Excited to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in The Journal of the Electrochemical Society focus issue on the Brain and Electrochemistry, honouring R. Mark Whiteman and Christian Amatore. Here, we show a quick and highly effective means of enhancing the sensitivity of enzymatic biosensors through electrode surface modifications.

These enzymatic sensors work by producing equal amount of hydrogen peroxide per target molecule observed. The hydrogen peroxide is then oxidised at the electrode as the means of detection. Hydrogen peroxide oxidation is highly surface dependent, as the peroxide must adsorb onto the electrode for the electron transfer to occur.

We demonstrate that roughening a platinum microelectrode before using it to fabricate an enzymatic biosensor givevs a massive increase in the sensitivity and a corresponding decrease in the limit of detection, without noticably impacting the response time.
