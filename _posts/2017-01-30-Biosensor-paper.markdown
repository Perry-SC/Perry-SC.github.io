Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in ChemElectroChem. Here, we combine enzymatic biosensors with scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) in order to provide localised detection.

The microelectrode design gives a biosensor tip around 100 micron in diameter. Positioning the tip of the biosensor close to a substrate then allows us to detect the release of active species. We prove this concept using a model D-serine substrate. We are therefore able to provide a sensor with high spatial and temporal resolution, as well as excellent selectivity thanks to the enzyme functionality.
