Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in Nature Materials Degradation. Here, we use scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to reveal titanium-rich inclusions in the surface of stainless steels, and reveal their role in corrosion processes.

Through combined localised and bulk electrochemical techniques along with digital simulation, we showed that these titanium rich sites show as conductive hot spots in an otherwise passive steel surface. Importantly, the fact that these sites show as being conductive means that they are in contact with the steel metal, and are not impeded by metal oxide, supporting that these sites can act as initiation points for corrosion of the stainless steel.

### Abstract

Titanium has been added to ferritic stainless steels to combat the detrimental effects of intergranular corrosion. While this has proven to be a successful strategy, we have found that the resulting Ti-rich inclusions present on the surface play a significant role in the initiation of other forms of localized corrosion. Herein, we report the effect of these inclusions on the localized corrosion of a stainless steel using macro and micro electrochemical techniques. Through the use of scanning electrochemical microscopy, we observe the microgalvanic couple formed between the conductive inclusions and passivated metal matrix. The difference in local reactivity across the materialâ€™s surface was quantified using a 3D finite element model specifically built to respect the geometry of the corrosion-initiating features. Combined with electron microscopy and micro elemental analysis, localization of other alloying elements has been reported to provide new insight on their significance in localized corrosion resistance.
