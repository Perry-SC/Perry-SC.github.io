Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in Nature Materials Degradation. Here, we use scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) to reveal titanium-rich inclusions in the surface of stainless steels, and reveal their role in corrosion processes.

Through combined localised and bulk electrochemical techniques along with digital simulation, we showed that these titanium rich sites show as conductive hot spots in an otherwise passive steel surface. Importantly, the fact that these sites show as being conductive means that they are in contact with the steel metal, and are not impeded by metal oxide, supporting that these sites can act as initiation points for corrosion of the stainless steel.
