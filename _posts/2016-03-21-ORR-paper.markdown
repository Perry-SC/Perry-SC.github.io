Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Denuault group in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. Here, we related the quantity of pre-adsorbed oxygen on a metal surface to the binding energy of that metal to oxygen. 

Though a specially designed cleaning and analysis potential waveform, we are able to detect the pre-adsorption of oxygen species at a microelectrode. Repeating at various metals shows a volcano-type relationship, similar to those often shown in computational studies to predict catalyst activity. In this way, we show a new descriptor for oxygen reduction catalyst activity based on experimental data, without computationally expensive requirements.
