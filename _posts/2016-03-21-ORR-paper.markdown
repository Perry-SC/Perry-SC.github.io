Delighted to announce the publication of our new paper from the Denuault group in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. Here, we related the quantity of pre-adsorbed oxygen on a metal surface to the binding energy of that metal to oxygen. 

Though a specially designed cleaning and analysis potential waveform, we are able to detect the pre-adsorption of oxygen species at a microelectrode. Repeating at various metals shows a volcano-type relationship, similar to those often shown in computational studies to predict catalyst activity. In this way, we show a new descriptor for oxygen reduction catalyst activity based on experimental data, without computationally expensive requirements.

### Abstract

Using chronoamperometry and voltammetry at oxide-free microelectrodes in non-adsorbing electrolyte, KClO<sub>4</sub>, we investigated the reduction of oxygen containing species which adsorb at potentials below those where oxides are grown electrochemically when the electrode is exposed to dissolved oxygen. Their coverage is found to vary with the metal substrate as follows, Ni > Cu > Pt > Ag, and is negligible on Au microdiscs. This dependence is consistent with the adsorption energy of atomic oxygen for the respective metals predicted by DFT. Furthermore the adsorption energies derived from the stripping peak potentials for the different metals agree very well with those predicted by the DFT calculations. We exploit the oxygen coverage differences between Pt, Pt<sub>0.9</sub>Rh<sub>0.1</sub> and Pt<sub>0.9</sub>Ir<sub>0.1</sub> microdiscs to predict the adsorption energy of these species on the Pt alloys and demonstrate a clear correlation between the metal activity towards the ORR and the charge associated with the reduction of the adsorbed oxygen species. In effect the coverage â€“ adsorption energy relationship turns the charge associated with the reduction of the adsorbed oxygen species into a descriptor of the electrode activity towards the ORR. This study provides new insight into the oxygen reduction reaction and offers a new methodology to investigate low temperature fuel cell ORR catalysts.
