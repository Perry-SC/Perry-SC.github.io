Pleased to announce the publication of our new paper  from the Mauzeroll group in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. Here, we show a simple new way to build finite elements simulations for corrosion reactions using Pourbaix diagrams.

The sections on the Pourbaix diagram show most thermodynamically stable species under a given potential or pH. In order words, as we read along the potential axis to more positive values, we see how the most thermodynamically stable species changes to more highly oxidised forms. 

Using the equations of the lines of a Pourbaix diagram therefore allows us to rapidly build a model to predict metal oxidation, based on the most thermodynamically stable species under the given conditions.
