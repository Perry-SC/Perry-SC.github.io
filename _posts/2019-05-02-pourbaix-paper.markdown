Pleased to announce the publication of our new paper  from the Mauzeroll group in the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. Here, we show a simple new way to build finite elements simulations for corrosion reactions using Pourbaix diagrams.

The sections on the Pourbaix diagram show most thermodynamically stable species under a given potential or pH. In order words, as we read along the potential axis to more positive values, we see how the most thermodynamically stable species changes to more highly oxidised forms. 

Using the equations of the lines of a Pourbaix diagram therefore allows us to rapidly build a model to predict metal oxidation, based on the most thermodynamically stable species under the given conditions.

### Abstract

Simulation of corrosion reactions has become an important tool in the analysis of novel materials for corrosion resistant materials and applications. A number of analytical, boundary element and finite element methods currently exist in the literature, which use experimental corrosion parameters as model inputs for the extraction of simulated polarization curves, oxide growth rates, and other corrosion behaviors. Here, we propose the combination of finite element simulation with thermodynamic data from Pourbaix diagrams to allow for the simulation of metal corrosion, where individual corrosion reactions can be monitored at the metal surface.
