Today I received an email from a researcher asking to work as a Post-doc in my lab. Unfortunately for the person in question, the message I received did not fill me with confidence either in their ability as a researcher or their actual desire to work in my department. As a result of this, I have decided to highlight a few key issues in this person's communication, and how better practices could greatly increase their chance of receiving a positive response.

I should add at this point, some of this post may seem like common sense. However, all of these points were badly dealt with in this one email that I received. As the old adage goes, common sense often isn't that common.

### The opening line


*Dear Professor...*

Possibly the worst start to an email that I could receive outside of actual profanity. Such a generic introduction. Now, I'm pretty sure from the start that this email was not only sent to me. Best-case scenario I have received a copy-pasted message with little thought about me involved. I might even be BCC'd in with a hundred other researchers, with the view that "any of these will do". If you want a reply to your email, at least take the time to find out my name! 

Even worse, a quick google would show that I'm not even a professor yet... thanks for rubbing it in!

### The initial pitch


*I am confident that working for you will...*

My problem with this sentence is the word *for*. As great as the movies were, I'm not looking for a minion. I'm looking for a colleague. Don't talk about working for me, or even working in my team. Talk about working with me. What are we going to do together? It may seem strange to talk on the same level when applying for a post, but equal discussion amongst peers promotes the highest-level science, so this is where you should start.

### Motivations


*...working for you will provide me with the experience ... to advance my career to the next level*

It's great that you think working for me will advance your career, but that's not much incentive for me to hire you over anyone else! If I'm adding to my team I want to know what you can bring that no one else can. What are we going to work on? Why should I be excited about what you will bring?

### Be specific


*...I would like to extend my support by writing research papers, projects and seeking funds through proposals*

Well... yes... that's the job description! Of course you will publish papers and seek funds. As in the previous point, this is far too generic. What will you research? Where will you publish? What funding agencies will you apply to? What research will you do? It doesn't have to be a full research proposal, but you should at least have a rough idea of what you'll ideally be doing in the lab for the first few months or so. Specific answers to these questions will convince me that you actually want to work with me, rather than that you're just looking for any position.

### Why me?

For me, the biggest thing missing from this email was why they were emailing me, rather than anyone else. Of course, this is contained within the bad start of *Dear Professor*, but it also highlights a bigger gap in this message. A message like this should make what this new researcher will bring to the lab abundantly clear. Note: this is not just in terms of their personal research plan, but also how they can enhance my existing research activities. Do your research, flick through my research goals / publication history and see where you could contribute. Maybe you've got a new experimental technique or theoretical model that could make my ideas work better or better explain how they work? If I can see the benefit to you being here with concrete examples, I'm far more likely to reply.

### Do your research

Perhaps I should have lead with this, but I am a project leader, not a lab leader. Regardless of how good this application is, as a Research Fellow I don't have the authority to hire anyone, so I'm the wrong person to contact. Of course, there's nothing wrong with contacting Research Fellows to ask about employment opportunities, or to enquire if they might be a good fit somewhere in the department. Many Post-docs I know would be happy to reply to an informal enquiry, but in this case it's even more important for the personal touch in your message.

### The key take home

Most of this post can be summarised in two sentences:

*Do your research*

*Don't copy-paste your message*

If you want to approach someone out of the blue and say you want to work with (not for!!) them, then the onus is on you to convince the reader that you are excited at the prospect of working with them, not just working with anyone who will reply. Of course, the job market is competitive, and it can be time consuming and sometimes scary putting yourself out there. Researching the post and sending a warm and personal email will still be no guarantee of a reply. Still, the more effort you put in to the personal touch, the better your chances will be, and eventually you will see the reward.

Good luck!
