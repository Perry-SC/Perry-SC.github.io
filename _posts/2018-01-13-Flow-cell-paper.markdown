Excited to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in The Journal of the Electrochemical Society. Here, we combine flow cell technologies with the benefit of microelectrodes to give access to new electrochemical information.

The new cell design integrates eight microelectrodes, which push through the cell wall into the centre of a flow cell tube. Combined experimental and simulated analysis shows how the cell can be used for electrochemical sensors, giving the fast sensing times of microelectrodes along with the batch analysis capabilities of flow cells.
