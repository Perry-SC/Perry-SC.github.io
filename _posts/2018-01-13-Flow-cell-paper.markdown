Excited to announce the publication of our new paper from the Mauzeroll group in The Journal of the Electrochemical Society. Here, we combine flow cell technologies with the benefit of microelectrodes to give access to new electrochemical information.

The new cell design integrates eight microelectrodes, which push through the cell wall into the centre of a flow cell tube. Combined experimental and simulated analysis shows how the cell can be used for electrochemical sensors, giving the fast sensing times of microelectrodes along with the batch analysis capabilities of flow cells.

### Abstract

A new type of an electrochemical flow cell designed for exchangeable ultramicroelectrodes (UMEs) is presented. The cell could be used with up to 8 different UMEs allowing one to use this cell for UME array measurements. The cell was characterized using both empirical data and finite element modeling. Au and Pt UMEs were used to detect catechol simultaneously, demonstrating the ability of this cell to be used as a sensory platform. The electroanalytical response of flow system was validated by direct measurements of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations. Finally, stochastic nanoparticle measurements were successfully performed using the flow system, highlighting the future possibilities of this system for environmental monitoring.
