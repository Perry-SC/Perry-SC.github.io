My recent attendance at a conference linking research and Government (check out my report [here]({% post_url 2020-03-09-STEM-for-Britain %})) highlighted just how important it is to be aware of how to communicate scientific information to the widest possible audience, especially if you want your research to have a meaningful impact. 

Scientific Communication is a real skill that requires as much practice as any other skill that you might want to develop. Unsurprisingly, there's a huge number of blog posts, articles, and other source of guidance offering key take-aways to hone your skills and facilitate your reach to a broader audience. I've been interested in this for a while now, so here are some of my favourite points... 

### Ask questions before you answer

When presenting scientific information to different audiences, it's important to remember that different people are going to be listening out for different pieces of information. This was highlighted pretty nicely when presenting my latest work on carbon dioxide conversion technologies. Chemistry were interested in the surface reactions at my catalyst, engineers were interested in the reactor design, business owners were interested in scale-up feasibility, and policy makers were interested in a time frame for future works. Now, image one of these people had asked an open ended phrase such as *"tell me about your project"*... these four groups would require totally different information to satisfy their curiosity. 

Before you start presenting your work, get an idea of who you are talking to. If you're asked *"tell me about your work"*, it's perfectly acceptable to start with *"before I start, could you tell me a little about your background?"* This will come across as considerate and professional, and will get you off on the best footing to providing a useful, tailored answer to their query.

### Be considerate of the other field

When discussing your work with someone from a different field, it can feel like you're speaking a different language. Facing the same problem, engineers might draw a schematic, chemists might put together a reaction mechanism or physicists might focus on equations. I recently saw this when talking to a computer scientist who wanted to model a chemical reaction. They had tried to solve this as a computer scientist, dealing with all reactions as model systems following set equations. Before we could have a conversation about the chemistry they were interesting in, I had to find a way to communicate that, although these model equations exist, real chemical systems are rarely that well behaved! 

Similar issues come into play when talking of experimental scale. A chemist might be excited by a reaction that works well in their 1 cm<sup>2</sup> cell, but an engineer might not be interested until it worked on a 1 m<sup>2</sup> reactor. The phrase "statistical significance" is also wildly different when comparing differing fields.  In psycholgy, a *p* value less than 0.05 indicates that the data is 95% certain to agree with the hypothesis, and is deemed to be significant, but recent measurements in the hunt for the Higgs Boson required *p* less than 0.0000003! On the other side of things, *p* values are completely meaningless to a non-scientist, but the phrase *"95% confidence"* offers a more accessible expression of how good the data is.

Both could finish hours apart but still say they were successful, and they'd both be right. It's important to consider eachother's perspectives when establishing a dialogue.

### Avoid jargon, abbreviations and acronyms 

Scientific literature is littered with jargon. Every paper you read will contain a number of acronyms, some helpful, others not so much (the infamous problem of defining an acronym for copper nanotubes comes to mind...). While we often get so used to this jargon we don't see it any more, it can be hugely limiting to a novice reader. Nothing kills the flow of a document like having to keep flicking back a few pages to look up what that SEM means... and how is that different to SECM again? Removing all jargon and abbrevations is a really fast way to increase accessibility, even if it isn't too kind on your word count!

### Cut out the detail (at least at first)

After spending months refining a methodology that now *finally* works reproducibly, it can be tempted to bombard people with all of the details of the multitude of hacks, tweaks and controls that you put in place to achieve your data. I've been guilty of this myself, especially when the fix allows good quality data for a system that hasn't worked for a very long time! However, your target audience is unlikely to try to repeat your exact experimental data, so do they need to know the painstacking parameterisation that went into the design, or do they just want to know how well it works? The same is true of theory, where it can be tempting to dive into all of the equations and mechanisms that your work is built on, when maybe a graphical overview would be more useful. 

A good rule of thumb is to start light on the detail (focusing on your target audience as we already mentioned). If you miss out a detail that they're interested in, that's what questions are for! It's much easier to add extra detail in a second pass over your explanation then recover someone from a glazed expression as they try to work out what you were talking about during that six step derivation.

### Final thought

Of course, this list is far from exhaustive. The main take home is a very simple one:

*Everyone is different, so every discussion has to be different*

Effective Scientific Communication tailors every presentation and every conversation to the needs of the listener, rather than the skills of the presenter. This may mean that the audience doesn't get to hear about all of the finer details involved in the work, but the idea is to impart enthusiasm and understanding not a detailed report; you won't be testing your audience after but wouldn't it be nice if they were excited enough to come talk to you after? Remember, it's very rare to give a presentation with no opportunity for disucssion. Question sessions will allow you to fill in any gaps, and you can guarantee that the questions will be focussed on the needs of the audience. Our goal should therefore to design our presentation to capture the imagination and get as many people as possible asking questions, getting involved, and enjoying science.
