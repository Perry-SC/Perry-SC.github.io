Excited to announce the publication of our new paper from the Denuault group in Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. Here, we provide evidence for the pre-adsorption of dissolved oxygen onto platinum electrodes before the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is driven by negative potentials. 

Though a specially designed cleaning and analysis potential waveform, we are able to differentiate the pre-adsorption of oxygen species at a platinum microelectrode from background charging processes and platinum oxidation. The quantity of pre-adsorbed oxygen is time dependent at short times until a partial monolayer is achieved, and appears related to the binding energy of the metal towards oxygen.
