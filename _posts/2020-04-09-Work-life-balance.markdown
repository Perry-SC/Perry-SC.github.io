I don’t know about anyone else, but when the Uni shutdown and I started working from home, I expected the toughest part to be getting as much done in my hastily thrown together home office as I did when I went into work. It turns out I had a much bigger challenge to face: 

*How do I maintain a work/life balance when I’m working at home?*

*What do I do when working at home starts to feel like living at the office?*

Academics are notoriously bad at maintaining a healthy work/life balance.<sup>1</sup> We’ve all caught ourselves checking work emails while the TV is on in the evening, or popping into the lab at the weekend to “just do one quick thing”, which then turns into a full day writing / experimenting / simulating / repairing / debugging / insert your own extra distracting option here. The link between work/life balance and mental health is pretty well established now, with one mental health charity stating that “the pressure of an increasingly demanding work culture in the UK is perhaps the biggest most pressing challenge to the mental health of the general population”.<sup>2</sup> 

When we’re at work there’s a relatively simply (if not always followed) rule that can help maintain some degree of balance:

*“When I’m at work I work, when I’m home I relax”*

Hardly fool-proof and regularly ignored but at least there are good intentions there that can stop the work-load getting too much and allow us to unwind. Relaxation once in a while is essential in keeping our stress levels low and protecting our mental health. Even if we only think from a working point of view, most of us can get more done in a shorter time feeling well rested than if we grind out a few extra hours feeling tired and unmotivated. 

So, with work well and truly invading our home lives, how do we maintain that healthy work/life balance? I’ve seen a fair few Twitter posts, articles and general discussions about little tips and tricks to help. Here are a few of my favourites…

### Have a “work space” separate from your “relax space”

This is definitely the most effective one for me. Ideally it would be great to have a dedicated office to shut the door on work at the end of the day, but we don’t all have that much space to spare! Appropriating some space in the Kitchen or Living Room works for me, especially as tidying away at the end of the day means I can’t keep dipping into work all night. The main thing for me is avoiding working in the bedroom… nothing worse than a pile of papers staring at me when I’m trying to sleep!

### Take advantage of the out of office email

This one never occurred to me before I saw it in a great Nature article on how to avoid burnout (check it out [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00353-5)).<sup>3</sup> Turns out that out of office emails aren’t just for holidays, you could switch them on at emails and weekends too! A couple of more strongly worded ones made their way onto Twitter, including this one…

<p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An out-of-office reply from a female Assistant Professor that warrants a tweet- “I do not respond to emails on weekends. If this is an emergency, please call my mobile. If you do not have my mobile number, then you do not have a weekend emergency.”</p>&mdash; Stephana Cherak (@sjcherak) <a href="https://twitter.com/sjcherak/status/1180918031712546816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>

I can’t remember the last time I went a weekend without checking work emails… now seems like a good time to try it out! With everyone working at home now my email load has markedly increased. We’ll have to see if taking a weekend off leads an overflowing inbox or a productive Monday morning (though I have a strong feeling it will be the latter).

### Dress for the day

When I get home from the office or the lab, the first thing I do is get changes. It’s a big psychological shift from work mode to relax mode. Working from home, the temptation to spend the day in PJs is seriously strong! I think we all know someone who’s taken Skype meeting with a baggy hoodie hastily thrown on, or with a smart shirt and carefully positioned camera hiding the 50/50 divide approach to smart/casual. Try out a change of clothes for the workday, even if it just means swapping sweats and a tshirt for jeans and a shirt. A friend of mine worked from home occasionally before the shutdown, and would always put on a shirt and tie as if he was heading into the office. Another has recently taken to wearing tuxedo for Skype meetings, dry Martini optional of course…

### Be realistic about what is expected

A big problem with work/life balance amongst academics is the following fear:

*“It looks like everyone else is working more than me”*

The myth that you have to work 80 hours a week is really well embedded in academic culture. A 2014 blog post by Dr Meghan Duffy stated that the idea isn’t only wrong it’s damaging.<sup>4</sup> Despite this, Dr Duffy said she was unsure about posting, as she was up for tenure and was unsure how it would be received. I have to admit I wasn’t sure about posting this myself as I’m looking to secure a permanent academic position myself… 

Turns out there was a lot of support for the post, including from the University Dean (and she got tenure so a happy ending all around!). The end message is that if you aren’t expected to work crazy hours at the office, then you aren’t expected to work crazy hours at home. Sometimes the realisation that you don’t have to behave a certain way is surprisingly motivating!

### Schedule regular breaks

It wasn’t until I started writing this that I realised how much I missed those regular water cooler breaks while I’m working. Just taking a few minutes every now and then to catch up with a colleague and chat about work or the weekend’s rugby made can be hugely refreshing. Sometimes, it’s helpful to schedule regular breaks. This can be as simple as turning away from the screen and stretching your legs every now and then. Now lots of us are working on laptops at home, we have to be even more careful about our eye and back health!

### Try different things

Probably the most important one… not everything works for everyone! We all have different work habits in the office so we’re all bound to work differently at home too. The main thing is to find what works for you. If you’re not feeling productive as things are try mixing things up. Maybe all, some or none of the above will help, maybe it turns out you ideal home office involves pulling your laptop out from under the bed with bleary eyes and never getting out from under the duvet. Each to their own. Whatever your style, working from home doesn’t have to mean struggling with work life balance. Mix it up, try new things and good luck!
