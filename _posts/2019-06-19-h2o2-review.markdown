Very excited to announce the publication of my new review into the electrochemical synthesis of hydrogen peroxide from water and oxygen in Nature Reviews Chemistry. This was a long time coming, with a huge amount of literature to cover. I am very greatful for the input from all of my collaborating authors from University of Southampton, Fraunhofer IGB, and Technical University Munich.

We summarise the greatest developments to date in this field, covering catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction and water oxidation reaction. We also discuss the latest reactor designs, and how they are workin towards tackling the challenges associated with up-scaling to industrially relevant yields.

### Abstract

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is important in large-scale industrial processes and smaller on-site activities. The present industrial route to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> involves hydrogenation of an anthraquinone and O<sub>2</sub> oxidation of the resulting dihydroanthraquinone — a costly method and one that is impractical for routine on-site use. Electrosynthesis of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is cost-effective and applicable on both large and small scales. This Review describes methods to design and assess electrode materials for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrosynthesis. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be prepared by oxidizing H<sub>2</sub>O at efficient anodic catalysts such as those based on BiVO<sub>4</sub>. Alternatively, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> forms by partially reducing O<sub>2</sub> at cathodes featuring either noble metal alloys or doped carbon. In addition to the catalyst materials used, one must also consider the form and geometry of the electrodes and the type of reactor in order to strike a balance between properties such as mass transport and electroactive area, both of which substantially affect both the selectivity and rate of reaction. Research into catalyst materials and reactor designs is arguably quite mature, such that the future of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> electrosynthesis will instead depend on the design of complete and efficient electrosynthesis systems, in which the complementary properties of the catalysts and the reactor lead to optimal selectivity and overall yield.
