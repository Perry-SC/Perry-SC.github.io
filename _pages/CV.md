Introduction
=================

<p align="justify">
I am an enthusiastic researcher, leading my team as part of an international collaboration tackling CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using electrochemistry. I take an active role in all aspects of the research environment, having written a number of grant applications and published fourteen papers in high impact journals. I have a great passion for teaching; I am a Fellow of AdvanceHE and I have given a number of classes for graduate courses and outreach lectures for young and international students. I am proud to mentor a number of research students and peers through research, learning and career goals. I enjoy taking an active role in the wider scientific community; I forged new collaborations with international Universities and am an active member of the Southampton University and Royal Society of Chemistry ECR Committees. I have spoken at eleven international conferences, and will be one of only three UK representatives at the inaugural Commonwealth Chemistry Congress in 2020. Outside of the lab, I am a keen guitarist, runner, rugby player and supporter of Harlequins RFU.
