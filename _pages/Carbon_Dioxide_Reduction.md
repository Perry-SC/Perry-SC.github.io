Overview
==========

<p align="justify"> The electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> is rapidly becoming an important field within electrochemistry, as it offers solutions to a number of concerns around CO<sub>2</sub> chemistry. The reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> towards carbon fuels such as methane provides an energy storage solution for intermittent green energy providers such as solar and wind.<sup>1-3</sup> Alternatively, the target of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction may be an industrially relevant compound such as CO<sup>4-8</sup> or ethylene.<sup>9-12</sup> In all cases, combination of CO<sub>2</sub> as a feedstock chemical with green power sources offers a synthetic route with a net decrease in total CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Ethylene in particular has received significant interest thanks to its use in the synthesis of polymers that would normally be sourced from fossil fuels.<br>
<br>
Currently, electrosynthesis of ethylene from CO<sub>2</sub> is hindered by a relatively low selectivity, with significant quantities of CO, H<sub>2</sub> or methane usually being the dominant side products.<sup>13, 14</sup> Additional problems appear when running these systems at high current densities, as increased overpotentials drive the reduction of water, resulting in a product mixture containing even more H<sub>2</sub>.<sup>15</sup> Much research has therefore been dedicated to designing reaction systems which can favour ethylene. So far, copper and copper alloy electrodes have dominated the literature, with simple copper electrodes already producing ethylene as the main electrochemical reduction product.<sup>16, 17</sup> Recent works have further improved on selectivity either by manipulation of the catalyst material,<sup>14, 18</sup> surface structure,<sup>9, 13, 19</sup> or solution.<sup>10, 20</sup> As well as producing ethylene from CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, these materials also have to either supress water reduction or lower the required overpotential for ethylene electrosynthesis, in order to inhibit the simultaneous formation of H<sub>2</sub>. <br>
<br>
A number of works have also demonstrated an increase in the current density for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction by changing the reaction vessel. CO<sub>2</sub> electochemistry is hindered by low CO<sub>2</sub> solubility.<sup>21</sup> The highest current densities are invariably produced through the use of gas diffusion electrodes (GDE), which remove this problem by flowing CO<sub>2</sub> in the gas phase through a porous electrode, so it then reacts at the gas-liquid interface.<sup>14, 18</sup> Additional improvements have been made by taking steps to improve the hydrophobicity of the electrodes, so that the electrode does not become saturated with solution and CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion is uninhibited within the gas phase.<sup>9</sup><br>

Our goals
==========

Our aims for this work can broadly be described by two main goals:

Goal 1 - Selectivity
--------------------
<p align="justify"> The first goal is to increase the selectvity of our system towards ethylene. Having an efficient system for the electrochemical synthesis of ethylene means that our product gas needs to be as high a percentage of ethylene as possible. Introduction of other compounds, such as unreacted CO<sub>2</sub> or other products such as H<sub>2</sub> or CO, mean that purification steps are needed before the ethylene is marketable. This greatly increases the costs of the process, reducing industrial or even lab scale viability.</p>

Goal 2 - Total Rate
--------------------
<p align="justify">The second goal is to increase the rate of reaction at our electrodes. This is a standard goal for all electrochemical synthesis works. If we can have a large rate at the electrode (defined as a large current density) we can have high yields of products with minimal power inputs. Unfortunately steps to work towards Goal 2 often negatively impact Goal 1 and vice versa, so a significant portion of our work will be finding a compromise between high selectivity and current density.</p>

Our methods
============

Fundamentals of the reaction
-----------------------------

<p align="justify"> The reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> is strongly surface dependent. The initial step in the reaction is the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> onto the electrode surface. Once this bond has been formed, then the electron transfers may occur. The overall mechanism is still uncertain, but a number of possible routes have been proposed,<sup>11, 22-24</sup> which are shown in Figure 1.<br>
<br>

</p>

Applications to catalyst design
--------------------------------

<p align="justify">The key thing to notice about the mechanism for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction is how the pathways can be seen to be interconnected. The route to ethylene proceeds via a number of intermediates, many of which could conceivable be released as products in their own right. With this in mind, we can start to imagine how we might go about designing a catalyst material to circumvent some of these problems.<br>
<br>
Firstly, even before we work on anything complicated, the type of material we use for our electrode has possible the largest impact on the selectivity of our electrode. Different materials have vastly different bond strengths towards different electroactive species, so it is vital to choose the correct material as the starting point for catalyst development. In our case, the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to ethylene is already selective at copper electrodes. In fact, just a simple piece of copper foil in a beaker shows reasonable selectivity towards ethylene thanks to its favourable bonding with aqueous CO<sub>2</sub>. Further developments can take this knowledge and improve the selectivity using the techniques that shall be discussed below.<br>
<br>
Secondly, we can think about the adsorption sites of incoming CO<sub>2</sub> molecules. The formation of ethylene as a C<sub>2</sub> molecule requires the formation of a carbon-carbon bond. It follows that a selective catalyst for ethylene should allow CO<sub>2</sub> to closely pack when adsorbing onto the electrode, as this will bring neighbouring CO<sub>2</sub> into close proximity and favour the C-C bond formation.<br>
<br>
Finally, we can focus on the strength of the bonding between CO<sub>2</sub> and the electrode, and also between the various intermediates between CO<sub>2</sub> and ethylene with the electrode. The reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> right through to ethylene requires a total of 12 electrons to be transferred. In order for this to happen, the bond between CO<sub>2</sub> and the electrode must be sufficiently strong to disfavour desorption before all 12 electrons are transferred. We also want strong bonds between all possible intermediates and the electrode surface, as this will favour further reduction over the formation of additional products.
</p>

Modifying the electrode structure
----------------------------------

<p align="justify">There are a number of modifications we can make to our electrode in order to favour certain types or strengths of adsorption. The key parameter here is the micro- or nano-structure of the metal surface. Introducing disorder into the surface of an electrode creates a lot of step, edge and defect sites. These are high energy binding sites, and show high activities towards many electrochemical reactions.<sup>13</sup> These sites also have distinct bond strength with species in solution, and can therefore be used to tune the overall activity and selectivity of an electrode. Complex surface structures can also affect the packing of adsorbed species, and so a targeted electrode structure can be used to force our CO<sub>2</sub> to adsorb closely together, favouring C-C bond formation.<br>
<br>
We have a number of possible routes for the formation of electrodes with highly active surface structures. Electrodeposition of aqueous copper ions onto an electrode surface automatically gives a high surface area copper surface with interesting features. Initially the copper deposits at active sites on the electrode in a nucleation step. Further growth then occurs from these copper sites, so it's possible to start with a small spare copper deposit, or grow it into a larger film of copper metal. Tuning the total charge passed and the deposition overpotential can change the types of copper particle that are formed, and so can tune the electrode's properties.<br>
<br>

<br>

Alternatively, rather than allowing random processes to determine the deposited copper structure, it is possible to strictly control the morphology of the copper through the use of a variety of templating techniques. The scope of templating techniques used in the literature is vast, including liquid crystal templating,<sup>25, 26</sup> aluminium oxide templating,<sup>27</sup> sacrificial co-alloy deposition<sup>28</sup> and gas evolution.<sup>29</sup> All of these techniques give widely different structures, and within their own fields can be tuned to give highly specific surfaces.<br>
<br>

<img align="center" src="/images/CO2/Deposition Techniques.png"><br clear="all">
<i><b>Figure 3.</b> A number of different techniques used to obtain similar structures of electrodeposited copper.</i>
<br>

<br>
The choice of templating techniques depends on the level of change desired in the electrode surface. Liquid crystal templating involves using a surfactant in a precise liquid-surfactant ratio to create columns at the electrode surface. Electrodeposition around these results in a honeycomb structure on the nanometre scale. On the other hand, alumina oxide templates have pores on the micrometre scale, resulting in much larger features. Often nanometre sized pores give a much larger surface area, although such small features can run into poisoning or electrode wetting effects so that not all of that extra surface area is actually active.<br>
<br>
In most cases it is hard to predict exactly how a certain microstructure would affect a specific reaction. DFT studies have shown that certain crystal faces or binding sites are specifically active towards certain reactions,<sup>30</sup> and certain micro- or nanostructures can be tuned to favour specific crystal faces. This has been most notably achieved with capping agents in the formation of metal nanoparticles, which have high surface areas and activities as electrochemical catalysts. In all cases, computational studies are an excellent starting point for predicting a desired electrode structure, with a subsequent parametric experimental approach to refine and develop the final catalyst material.<br>

</p>

Modifying the reaction environment
-----------------------------------

<p align="justify">As well as the nature of the electrode it is also important to consider how CO<sub>2</sub> is provided to the electrode itself. Aqueous electrochemistry of CO<sub>2</sub> is hindered by a low solubility and diffusion coefficient of aqueous CO<sub>2</sub> in electrolytes. To get around this, most works use gas diffusion electrodes, so that the CO<sub>2</sub> remains in the gas phase as it diffuses through the back of the electrode. The CO<sub>2</sub> then dissolves into the electrolyte at the gas-liquid interface, where it is rapidly reduced by the electroactive material in close proximity. This almost immediate consumption of CO<sub>2</sub> as soon as it enters the liquid phase allows for a rapid rate of reaction without having to approach the solubility limit of CO<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte.<br>
<br>
Other popular reactor designs are built on the same concept of maximising the mass transport rate of CO<sub>2</sub> and circumventing the solubility issue. One such design that is worth mentioning is the trickle bed reactor. Here, the catalyst is loaded on a particulate material in a reactor. CO<sub>2</sub> gas and liquid electrolyte are introduced into the top of the reactor and allowed to trickle own by gravity. The electrolyte forms a thin film over the catalyst material, and so the CO<sub>2</sub> only gas to diffuse a short distance before being reduced at the electrode.<br>
<br>

<i><b>Figure 4.</b> Schematic diagrams for a gas diffusion electrode and trickle bed reactor for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to ethylene.</i>
<br>

<br>
Further developments in this field will almost certainly be built up on one of these designs, with future works looking to maximise the reactor output through large surface area designs or stacked electrodes.<br>
