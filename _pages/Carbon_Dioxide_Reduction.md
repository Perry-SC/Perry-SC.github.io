# Overview

Lowering CO<sub>2</sub> levels is a global challenge, requiring a unified approach from the public, research and policy makers. We are all increasingly aware of changes we can make to lessen our environmental impact, but what about CO<sub>2</sub> from sources that we cannot avoid, like vital industrial process or fermentation? 

One option is to capture that CO<sub>2</sub> as it's released and convert it into something useful. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction is a multi-step electrochemical process that uses electron tranfders from a catalytic electrode and reactions with water to make a number of different possible products. This is exciting, as we can capture CO<sub>2</sub> that would be released into the atmosphere to use as our starting material, so it doesn't go into the environment. Many of the products that we can make are normally sourced from fossil fuels, so our CO<sub>2</sub> reduction method is doubly benefically in reducing our carbon footprint! This same technology could also provide security to intermittent green energy sources. During the day, excess solar energy could convert CO<sub>2</sub> into biofuel, then at night the biofuel can be used to supplement the energy grid.

<figcaption>Our schematic research plan. 1. CO<sub>2</sub> is captured from industrial sources before it is released into the atmosphere, and fed into our new reactor. 2. The reactor is powered by green energy sources. 3. Water is fed into the other side of the reactor to balance the charge. 4. The product (in our case, ethylene) is collected, purified, and used for a variety of applications.</figcaption>

# The problem

Unfortunately, industrial applications of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction are presently limited by a number of factors. One of the most challenging is the issue of selectivity. CO<sub>2</sub> reduction does not produce on single product; instead it produces a mixture of lots of different possible products. This is a problem, as if we want to market CO<sub>2</sub> reduction as a way to produce useful materials, we need a pure product, not a random mixture. 

Certain materials are naturally included to make more of one specific product: tin electrodes favour formate, silver favours carbon monoxide, and copper gives a mixture of methane and ethylene, amongst other products. Copper is a particularly interesting as it is the only material capable of taking CO<sub>2</sub> and using it to make products with carbon-carbon bonds. This is where our research comes in, as we want to make ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) so that carbon-carbon bond formation will determine how much product we get. 

# Our research

We are using a number of different methods to try to push copper electrodes to produce more ethylene than any of the other possible CO<sub>2</sub> reduction products. These include special electrode coatings that trap CO<sub>2</sub> close to the electrode surface, and modifying the surface structure of the electrodes to increase their activity.
